    <h1>HTML BASICS</h1>
    <h2>Headings</h2>
    <p>
      Headings in HTML are similar to headings in other types of media. For
      example, in newspapers, large headings are typically used to capture a
      reader’s attention. Other times, headings are used to describe content,
      like the title of a movie or an educational article.
    </p>
    <p>
      HTML follows a similar pattern. In HTML, there are six different headings,
      or heading elements. Headings can be used for a variety of purposes, like
      titling sections, articles, or other forms of content.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following is the list of heading elements available in HTML. They are
      ordered from largest to smallest in size
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        h1 — used for main headings. All other smaller headings are used for
        subheadings.
      </li>
      <li>h2</li>
      <li>h3</li>
      <li>h4</li>
      <li>h5</li>
      <li>h6</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Lets See how they are written in Vs code</p>

    <h2>HTML Paragraphs</h2>
    <p>Paragraph element</p>
    <p>
      contains and displays a block of text. They are among the most common
      text-based HTML elements.
    </p>
    <p>
      They are block-level, which means it is as wide as it’s parent element and
      as tall as its content’s height.
    </p>

    <h2>HTML Formatting Elements</h2>
    <p>Formatting elements were designed to display special types of text:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>b - Bold text</li>
      <li>strong - Important text</li>
      <li>i - Italic text</li>
      <li>em - Emphasized text</li>
      <li>mark - Marked text</li>
      <li>small - Smaller text</li>
      <li>del - Deleted text</li>
      <li>ins - Inserted text</li>
      <li>sub - Subscript text</li>
      <li>sup - Superscript text</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>HTML Quotation and Citation Elements</h2>
    <p>
      In this chapter we will go through the <b>blockquote</b>,<b>q</b>,
      <b>abbr</b>, <b>address</b>, <b>cite</b>, and <b>bdo</b> HTML elements.
    </p>
    <p>
      The HTML <b>blockquote</b> element defines a section that is quoted from
      another source. Browsers usually indent <b>blockquote</b> elements.
    </p>
    <p>
      The HTML <b>q</b> tag defines a short quotation. Browsers normally insert
      quotation marks around the quotation.
    </p>
    <h2>Lists</h2>
    <p>Lists are divided into two: Unordered Lists and Ordered Lists</p>
    <h3>Unordered Lists</h3>
    <p>
      In addition to organizing text in paragraph form, you can also display
      content in an easy-to-read list.
    </p>

      In addition to organizing text in paragraph form, you can also display
      content in an easy-to-read list.
    </p>
    <p>
      In HTML, you can use an unordered list tag (ul) to create a list of items
      in no particular order. An unordered list outlines individual list items
      with a bullet point.
    </p>
    <p>Lets see how its done in Vs code</p>
    <h2>Ordered Lists</h2>
    <p>
      Ordered lists (ol) are like unordered lists, except that each list item is
      numbered. They are useful when you need to list different steps in a
      process or rank items for first to last.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can create the ordered list with the (ol) tag and then add individual
      list items to the list using (li) tags.
    </p>

    <h2>HTML Links - Hyperlinks</h2>
    <p>
      HTML links are hyperlinks. You can click on a link and jump to another
      document. When you move the mouse over a link, the mouse arrow will turn
      into a little hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Note</b>: A link does not have to be text. A link can be an image or
      any other HTML element!
    </p>
    <h4>Absolute URLs vs. Relative URLs</h4>
    <p>
      Both examples above are using an absolute URL (a full web address) in the
      href attribute. A local link (a link to a page within the same website) is
      specified with a relative URL (without the "https://www" part):
    </p>
    <p>Lets see how to write them in Vs code</p>
    <h2>Images</h2>
    <p>
      All of the elements you’ve learned about so far (headings, paragraphs,
      lists, and spans) share one thing in common: they’re composed entirely of
      text! What if you want to add content to your web page that isn’t composed
      of text, like images?
    </p>
    <p>
      The <b>img</b> tag allows you to add an image to a web page. Most elements
      require both opening and closing tags, but the <b>img</b> tag is a
      self-closing tag. Note that the end of the <b>img</b> tag has a forward
      slash /. Self-closing tags may include or omit the final slash — both will
      render properly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <b>img</b> tag has a required attribute called src. The src attribute
      must be set to the image’s source, or the location of the image. In this
      case, the value of src must be the uniform resource locator (URL) of the
      image. A URL is the web address or local address where a file is stored.
    </p>

    <h2>Videos</h2>
    <p>
      In addition to images, HTML also supports displaying videos. Like the
      <b>img</b> element, the <b>video</b> element requires a src attribute with
      a link to the video source. Unlike the <b>img</b> element however, the
      <b>video</b> element requires an opening and a closing tag.
